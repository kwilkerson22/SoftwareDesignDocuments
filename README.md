// Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?

The client, The Gaming Room would like to move their Android based game Draw It or Lose It to a web based game that can function on different operating systems. This is a team oriented game and the object is for your team to score the most points by correctly guessing a series of puzzles through using visual clues.

// What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?

I did well with considering and overcoming potential design constraints that could impact the game development. I also did well in regards to the domain model. I tied in the UML Diagram and the principles of OOP(Object Oriented Programming) in order to provide an in depth explanation of how the application would work on the server side. 

// What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?

The most helpful aspect was looking at the UML Diagram. Looking at the big picture helped me redesign the classes of the application into a Singleton design which was needed since the client wanted only one instance of the game to exist in memory. 

// If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

I would revise the development requirements section to include a discussion of cloud-based operating systems. I think this could be a viable alternative if memory and storage capacity is exceeded on a physical server. This would also change the cost of development and the priorities of the developer when building the applicaiton. 

// How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

I made sure to create a clear requirements section in my design document and follow it carefully when executing it in code. I thought about the user's needs in regards to security as well as gameplay. Looking at the application from the user's point of view makes sure that software design moves beyond minimally meeting functionality and creating an experience where the user will return and continue using the application. 

// How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?

I made sure to balance my considerations of the client side and server side. In order for the user to have a pleasant experience, there must be minimal lag, smooth framerates and a nice interface. I think this approach will be useful in my future development because both sides need to be optimized in order to create a successful application.
